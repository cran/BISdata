v0.1-0  (2022-03-07)

  o First release. The package provides functions for
    downloading data from the Bank for International
    Settlements (BIS; https://www.bis.org/ ) in Basel.
    Supported are only full datasets in (typically) CSV
    format.  The package is lightweight and without
    dependencies; suggested packages are used only if data
    is to be transformed into particular data structures,
    such as 'zoo' objects. Downloaded data can optionally
    be cached, to avoid repeated downloads of the same
    files.
