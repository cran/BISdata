  o 'fetch_dataset' gains several arguments, such as
    'header' and 'sep', which define the default settings
    for 'read.table'. The function now correctly parses
    datasets such as 'full_spp_csv.zip' that use
    double-quoted elements (thanks to Matthias
    Meiksner/IZE85 for reporting on GitHub).

  o there is an additional public repository at sourcehut:
    https://git.sr.ht/~enricoschumann/BISdata

    'frequency'

v0.1-1  (2022-03-07)

  o First release. The package provides functions for
    downloading data from the Bank for International
    Settlements (BIS; https://www.bis.org/ ) in Basel.
    Supported are only full datasets in (typically) CSV
    format.  The package is lightweight and without
    dependencies; suggested packages are used only if data
    is to be transformed into particular data structures,
    such as 'zoo' objects. Downloaded data can optionally
    be cached, to avoid repeated downloads of the same
    files.
